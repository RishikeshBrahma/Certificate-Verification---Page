🎯 Usage:

* Upload CSV
Visit: http://localhost:5000/upload
Upload a CSV file with the following columns:
certificate_id
recipient_name
course_title
issue_date
Example:-
certificate_id,recipient_name,course_title,issue_date
CERT123,John Doe,Python Programming,2025-07-04
CERT456,Jane Smith,Data Science,2025-07-05

* Verify Certificate
Go to: http://localhost:5000/verify
Enter a certificate ID (e.g., CERT123)
The system will generate a QR code.
Scan the QR code or use the manual download link to download the CSV file.

📌 Troubleshooting
📶 Ensure your device is on the same network as the server for QR code scanning.
🛠️ Verify MySQL credentials and database setup.
🔐 Check directory permissions if files are not saving correctly.
